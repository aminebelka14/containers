# container

This project is a C++ implementation of common STL containers — specifically `vector`, `map`, and `stack`. The goal is to recreate these standard data structures from scratch, mimicking their behavior as closely as possible without relying on the standard library versions.

## Features

- 🧱 Custom implementation of:
  - `Vector`
  - `Map`
  - `Stack`
- ⚙️ Written entirely in **C++**
- 📦 Header-only: just include and use

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (supporting C++98 or later)
- A C++ project or file to include the headers
